Hey there! I’m Stefan.

I’m an undergrad at the University of Washington, majoring in Computer Science. I love hackathons, web development, and reading tech news. Most of my side projects revolve around exploring new languages and making my friends laugh. 

I currently work for UW CSE’s IT department, and I will be interning at Simply Measured this summer. 

I also love learning (spoken) languages, and I am partially fluent in swedish and spanish.

Social media links



I host most of my projects on github. Here are some of my favorites:

StefChat, a snapchat clone for iOS I wrote in a weekend using parse.

NameTag, an android app that lets you share contact information over bluetooth quickly. //built for AngelHack Seattle 2013

stfn.me/sdierauf.sexy/stefan.dierauf.com, the code for this site (now running on the MEAN stack)

Mr. Nice Hangman, a javascript/bootstrap reimplementation of EvilHangman (go ahead, try to beat it).

Surplusifier, a simple tool I built after getting frustrated with some of CSE IT’s own internal tools.

Engineering Jargon Generator, a jargon generator slapped together after one too many linear algebra problems. 

I love hackathons, as they force me to learn a lot of new stuff really fast. I’ve previously attended: 

Angelhack’s Apphack, where we built an android app that lets users swap social network information over bluetooth quickly. 

Out 4 Undergrad’s closing hackathon, where we designed a site like eventbrite that would also help you connect with people at the event.

PayPal’s BattleHack Seattle, where I fell in love with javascript and Bootstrap.

The UW engineering community hackathon, where I took third place in the highest coding skill tier.
